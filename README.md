This project focuses on developing and comparing different CNN models for efficient bird species identification using images  
Here we used InceptionV3, ResNet50 and DenseNet201 architectures.
Used Adam optimizer with learning rate le-2, Softmax function for classification and categorical cross entropy for calculating loss function
The proposed system works on the principle based on extracting CNN features from multiple convolutional layers. These features are aggregated and then given to classifier for classification purpose. On basis of the results which has been produced, ResNet50 had provided 95.45% accuracy in predictions of finding bird species.![17414287799611690236373953450295](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f67168d3-1e0e-44c9-a150-30319625a287)
